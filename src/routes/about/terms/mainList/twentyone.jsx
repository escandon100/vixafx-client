                <li>JURISDICTION
                    <p>Each of the parties irrevocably:</p>
                    <p>agrees that the courts of US shall have jurisdiction to settle any suit, action or other proceedings relating to this Agreement (“Proceedings”) and irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such courts regardless of whether or not you are resident and/or domiciled outside US (provided that this shall not prevent us from bringing an action in the courts of any other jurisdiction); and</p>
                    <p>waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court and agrees not to claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum or that such court does not have jurisdiction over it. P24O reserves the right to take legal action before the court/s of your domicile or before any other competent court in any other jurisdiction in which case US law will still apply.</p>
                </li>

                    <p>You irrevocably waive to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to yourself and your revenue and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use) all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from suit; jurisdiction of any courts; relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property; attachment of assets (whether before or after judgment); and execution or enforcement of any judgment to which you or your revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agree that you will not claim any immunity in any Proceedings. You consent generally in respect of any Proceedings to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with such Proceedings, including, without limitation, the making, enforcement or execution against any property whatsoever (irrespective of its use or intended use) of any order or judgment which may be made or given in such Proceedings.</p>
